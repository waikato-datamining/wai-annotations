- Logging changes.
- Moved utilities for each format into their own sub-package.
- Added reader options to read input files from list files.

0.1.1 (2020-01-23)

  box area.

------------------

- Added the ability to specify inputs by glob syntax, and also specify negative
  images with no annotations.
- Added utility functions for images (image_to_numpyarray, remove_alpha_channel)
  and for masks (mask_to_polygon, polygon_to_minrect, polygon_to_lists) in module wai.annotations.image_utils
- Added --extensions option to control the search order for associated images.
- Added --verbosity flag to control logging verbosity.
- Added polygon mask support to the ROI format.

0.0.4 (2020-01-15)

  of pycocotools. Moved pycocotools to end of dependency list to ensure all
  requirements are met before installation.

------------------

- Changed --coerce option to --force.
- Tensorflow is no longer a dependency in setup.py as can work with
