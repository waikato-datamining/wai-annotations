- Bug fix where previous registry incarnation was being loaded instead of new version.

0.3.0 (2020-03-18)
------------------

- Converted formats to use a plug-in system so other libraries can define their own formats.

0.2.3 (2020-03-17)
------------------

- Upgraded wai.common requirement to v0.0.28.
- Separated main settings from library settings.
- Changed ``--include-zero-area`` flag to min/max width/height/area flags.
- Added ``--comments`` option for ROI writer to insert comments at the beginning
  of written files.
- Input directories read all contained files ending in ``.report`` when using ``adams`` format.
- Added ``--sample-stride`` option to tfrecords input which sub-samples the mask when generating
  the polygon for speed increase.
- Added ``--mask-threshold`` option to tfrecords input which sets the probability to consider
  the mask inside the polygon.
- Internal format is now an object rather than a tuple.
- Added ``--size-mode`` flag to ROI format which writes ROI files with x,y,w,h headers rather
  than x0,y0,x1,y1 headers.

------------------

- Upgraded wai.common requirement to v0.0.26.

  the supplied `planar.Polygon` object

0.2.0 (2020-03-06)
------------------

- Conversions now automatically discard annotations with zero area, can be reverted
  with ``--include-zero-area`` flag.
- `image_utils.mask_to_polygon` can now work with a view of the mask instead of
  the full mask to speed up the polygon detection
- Modified utilities for getting labels/prefixes to be able to specify a default value.

- Added requirement for wai.json v0.0.4.

0.1.4 (2020-02-18)
------------------

- Added compatibility layer for Tensorflow V1.

------------------

- Upgraded wai.common requirement to v0.0.22.

0.1.2 (2020-01-24)

- Fixed default filename for ROI format ("-rois.csv" rather than "-roi.csv").
- Added the ability to specify a prefix and suffix for reading/writing ROI files.
- Logging changes.
- Moved utilities for each format into their own sub-package.
- Added reader options to read input files from list files.

0.1.1 (2020-01-23)
------------------

- Separated command-line option parsing from io/converter classes so that imports
  unique to specific formats are not required unless using that format.
- Refactoring of package structure.
- Added logging of when files are being written.
- Conversion to COCO format now report polygon mask area, rather than just bounding-
  box area.
- Added support for non-standard keywords to the ROI format.

0.1.0 (2020-01-22)
------------------

- Added the ability to specify inputs by glob syntax, and also specify negative
  images with no annotations.

  and for masks (mask_to_polygon, polygon_to_minrect, polygon_to_lists) in module wai.annotations.image_utils
- Added --extensions option to control the search order for associated images.
- Added --verbosity flag to control logging verbosity.
- Added polygon mask support to the ROI format.

0.0.4 (2020-01-15)
------------------

- Modified requirements to include Cython as this is required in later versions
  of pycocotools. Moved pycocotools to end of dependency list to ensure all
